# React Native Job Finder App

Hello fellow developers! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the React Native Job Finder App, a project that represents the culmination of my efforts in honing my skills in React Native development. Throughout the journey of building this app, I've had the opportunity to delve into various aspects of mobile app development, crafting a robust and feature-rich application.

## Functionalities

### 1. Welcome Page
- The app features a visually appealing welcome page that introduces users to the Job Finder application.
- Users are greeted with an inviting interface that sets the tone for a positive user experience.

### 2. Job Search Page
- This page allows users to search for jobs based on specific criteria.
- The search functionality is implemented to fetch job data from an external API, providing real-time job information.
- Users can input search parameters, such as job title, location, etc., to tailor their job search.

### 3. Job Details Page
- After selecting a job from the search results, users can view detailed information about the chosen job.
- The job details page displays essential information such as job title, company details, job description, etc.

### 4. Pagination
- To enhance user experience and accommodate large sets of job data, pagination functionality is implemented.
- Users can navigate through multiple pages of job search results seamlessly.
